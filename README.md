# android-todo
A very very simple todo app for android devices

## Why?

In order to brush up on native android development which I haven't touched in over 3 years, I chose to build a simple todo list app.

## Features

Don't expect much. It's a single activity that uses an SQLite database to store tasks when you add them, and marking them as "done" just deletes the task from the db.

## You could have done XXX better...

I would not be surprised. The code here was hobbled together in 2 hours from reading several documentation and reference sources.
As said before, I have not touched native android in over 3 years. It has changed a lot, and I've never worked with the visual activity design tools before this project.

## This is cool.

Well thanks. ðŸ˜Ž
